#   Simple Will Statement Smart Contract

A will testament is a legal document that expresses a person's wishes as to how their property is to be distributed after their death and as to which person is to manage the property until its final distribution.

In my logics:

The owner will deploy the contract with Ether

Owner set the address and the amount to express how it's ether will be distributed.

When owner is decreased, The child with the address of the owner can now toggle the decreased == true

This will call a function to distrubute the assets to each individual in the family wallet according to the will of the owner.
